# Exception Handling in Python

Exception handling allows you to predict and manage errors that might occur during program execution. Sometimes, you need to let your program fail to identify which exceptions to handle.

## Basics of Exception Handling

The simplest way to handle exceptions in Python is by using `try` and `except` clauses:

1. **`try` Clause**: Executes all statements until an exception occurs.
2. **`except` Clause**: Catches and handles the exception(s) raised in the `try` clause.

### How It Works:
- Python runs the `try` clause.
  - If **no error** occurs, the `except` clause is skipped, and execution continues.
  - If an **error** occurs, Python skips the rest of the `try` clause and transfers control to the matching `except` block.
- If no matching `except` block is found, the exception becomes unhandled, and the program stops with an error message.

### Key Points:
- A `try` block can have multiple `except` clauses to handle different exceptions.
- Be specific about the exceptions you handle to avoid catching unintended errors.

## Raising Exceptions

You can raise exceptions manually when certain conditions are not met. This is useful when:
- A file doesn’t exist.
- A network or database connection fails.
- Invalid input is received.

### Example:
```python
if num2 == 0:
    raise ZeroDivisionError("The denominator is zero.")
```

## Example: Exception Handling in File Operations

### Basic Exception Handling:
```python
def read_file(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            return f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "File not found!"
    finally:
        print("Finished reading file.")
```

### Enhanced Exception Handling:
```python
def enhanced_read_and_divide(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            data = file.readlines()

        # Ensure there are at least two lines
        if len(data) < 2:
            raise ValueError("Not enough data in the file.")

        num1 = int(data[0])
        num2 = int(data[1])

        # Check if the second number is zero
        if num2 == 0:
            raise ZeroDivisionError("The denominator is zero.")

        return num1 / num2

    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "Error: The file was not found."
    except ValueError as ve:
        return f"Value error: {ve}"
    except ZeroDivisionError as zde:
        return f"Division error: {zde}"
    finally:
        print("Finished processing the file.")
```

### Potential Issues:
- **File-level issues**:
  - File not found → `FileNotFoundError`
  - Not enough data → `ValueError`
- **Data-level issues**:
  - Invalid data → `ValueError`
  - Division by zero → `ZeroDivisionError`

## Assert Statements

`assert` statements verify that a condition is true. If not, they raise an `AssertionError`. They are useful for:
1. Detecting problems early in development.
2. Documenting assumptions in the code.

### Example:
```python
assert num2 != 0, "The denominator cannot be zero."
```

## Key Takeaways

- Use `try` and `except` to handle predictable errors.
- Be specific about the exceptions you handle.
- Use `assert` to validate conditions during development.
- Raise exceptions to signal errors when necessary.
